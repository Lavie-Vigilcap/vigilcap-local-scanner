# Vigilcap Assurance Engine (Core Scanner)

### 🔒 Trustless Verification Architecture
This repository contains the open-source inspection logic used by the **Vigilcap Financial Intelligence Platform**. 

We open-source our core scanning module to allow asset owners (Sellers) and acquirers (Searchers) to verify our security promises:
1.  **Local Execution:** All code analysis happens on the host machine.
2.  **No Exfiltration:** Source code is never uploaded to Vigilcap servers or third-party clouds.
3.  **Transparency:** The logic used to count complexity and identify secrets is visible and audit-ready.

**Note:** The Financial Quantification Engine, Remediation Capex Models, and AI Narrative Synthesis modules are proprietary and included only in the compiled binary distribution.
